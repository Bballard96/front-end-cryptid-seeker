# Ice Box
- AAU I want to add a pin to a map to indicate where I saw a cryptid
- AAU I'd like to add a cryptid not currently on the list.
- AAU I want to like a comment or post
- AAU I should be able to toggle between dark and light mode.
- AAU I should be able to see my own and others' profile pages.
- AAU I should be able to see different categories for confirmed sightings or potential sightings in the newsfeed.
- AAU I would like to see an "about us" page that allows me to see the developers who created the app, details their contributions, and lists their favorite cryptid.
